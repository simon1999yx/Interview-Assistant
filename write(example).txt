Additional info: yeah I mean I don't have such long time like amongst to finish this test I only have 5 to 7 days
Can you outline the timeline of your work on this coding task? How much time was allocated to each sub-task?
Please speak...
Processing...
You said: yeah of course I think I have several days to finish so I divided into four parts and for each other subjects I have one days to finish and to desktop
Generated response: It sounds like you have a well-structured plan for managing your workload. Can you tell me more about how you decided on dividing your tasks into four parts, and how you plan to allocate your time for each subject?

Additional info: I think that space on the experience that I think connect to Transportation part of this task and of course yeah it is so so I think that's complete based on the personal experience
What were the main challenges you encountered for the coding task, and what lessons did you learn from them?

You said: yeah I think the monster challenge part of this task is to connect to the AI models because at the beginning I use wrong model I used to I think it's free and of course it can solve the problem like gypsies 3.5 but to the end I found the distributed to its kind of kind of like owning good and produce a new story don't cannot summarize or cannot grab the important key words from from from from from a very massive contacts so to completely for this task so I have to change the whole coding project to use GPS 3 on Spotify
Generated response: It seems like you encountered a challenge while working on connecting to the AI models for your task. Initially, you used a free model that you thought could solve the problem like GPT-3.5, but later on, you realized that it lacked the necessary capabilities, particularly in processing large amounts of content and generating new stories. As a result, you had to switch to using GPT-3 on Spotify for your coding project. Can you tell me more about how this switch impacted your project and its overall outcome?

How did you ensure the usability and aesthetic appeal of your application interface Can you share your design and implementation strategies?
Please speak...

You said: yeah I think because this process is very very clear very direct just asked a question get the answer and analyze the answer deep in the question and then summarize the different summarize all the question and answer together so I think this this process is very clear and direct so do you think that should be very direct don't don't involve some very tricky tricky tricky information inside of it so I just make a very direct using the face without any information in it just put the words and the question on screen
Generated response: It sounds like you appreciate the straightforward and clear process of asking questions, getting answers, analyzing them, and then summarizing the overall conversation. You prefer to keep things direct without any tricky or unnecessary information. This approach helps you focus on the main points and easily understand the discussion.

What steps did you take to maintain professional code quality and application appearance?
Please speak...

You said: because I'm not a professional programmer so I think try as many as I can as the is the only way that I can maintain the cold quality if I want short shorts in the cold I have to ask a charge of it for help and you see some online resources for example the first I don't know how to use for to make those comments so can repeat so many times and I learned from charity so I think that's kind of like a learning process
Generated response: It sounds like you are learning programming through trial and error, which can be a great way to improve your skills, especially if you are not a professional programmer. It's important to practice and seek help when needed, whether through online resources or asking others for assistance. Learning from your mistakes and repeating the process can be a valuable part of the learning journey. Keep up the good work!

Reflecting on your experience with this coding task, what are three key takeaways you would like to emphasize?
Please speak...
Processing...
You said: yeah of course I think the important part is to make fully preparation choose the right model at first and the second one is to iteration the coating iteration accounting when a nursery sometimes you feel about this is called wrong but some function is not that is not forever because you always get something to improve make a stop at some point when you say something about the usability is kind of like it's great that's all I don't have 266 enough
Generated response: It sounds like you emphasize the importance of thorough preparation and selecting the right model as a crucial initial step. You also mentioned the significance of iteration in refining processes and acknowledging that setbacks are not permanent, as there is always room for improvement. Finally, you alluded to knowing when to pause and evaluate usability as essential during project development. Could you expand on your experience with iterating and optimizing processes as part of your work or projects?
Speak now...
Processing additional info...
Additional info: yeah for this project I it at least the five times the first time is the wrong model the second time it's about the loop to make the process quicker I mean the system quicker and the second the third time is to to design a user interface because I think looking at the wrong the the the pythons looking at the prices for and the force the 5th is all about how to make the summary better how to make the I can even make a summary at the same time so I think that's kind of like keep patience yeah that's the point
What aspects of the coding task do you believe you handled well, and what tips can you offer based on your experience?
Please speak...
Processing...
You said: yeah I think for for the for the coding task I desire a good user experience in especially the especially the summarized part because you know sometimes you answer too many things you don't understand you don't you don't know how much since you provide to the sister and you don't know what kind of things is repeat so I Make some noise when the computer when I think that you provide enough information I think that's a very good point and the second part about the good things are made of because so many different model to choose the right one for summarize and write 140 + that makes the system very kind of like a real person and my perspective so that's all
Generated response: It sounds like you value a good user experience, especially when it comes to summarizing information efficiently. You appreciate when a system can recognize when enough information has been provided and can effectively summarize it. Additionally, you find it beneficial when there are various models to choose from in order to produce high-quality summaries tailored to your needs.
